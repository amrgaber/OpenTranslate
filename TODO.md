# TODO List for PO File Translator

This document outlines some potential enhancements for the PO File Translator script.

## 1. Support for More Translation APIs

Currently, the script uses Google Translate for translation. It would be great to add support for more translation APIs, such as Microsoft Translator, Yandex.Translate, and DeepL. This would provide more options for users and could potentially improve the quality of translations.

## 2. GUI Interface

A graphical user interface (GUI) would make the script more user-friendly. Users could select files, choose languages, and start translations with a few clicks, without needing to use the command line.

## 3. Progress Indicator

When translating large PO files, it can take some time for the script to complete. A progress indicator would give users a better idea of how long the translation will take.

## 4. Error Handling and Retry Mechanism

The script could be improved by adding more robust error handling. For example, if a translation request fails, the script could retry the request a certain number of times before giving up. This would make the script more resilient to temporary issues with the translation API.

## 5. Configuration File Support

Instead of specifying all options on the command line, it would be convenient to have a configuration file where users can set their preferences. This would be especially useful for users who frequently use the script with the same options.

## 6. Automated Tests

Adding automated tests would help ensure the script works as expected and makes it easier to add new features or make changes in the future.

## 7. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Setting up a CI/CD pipeline would automate the testing and deployment process, ensuring that the script is always in a releasable state.
